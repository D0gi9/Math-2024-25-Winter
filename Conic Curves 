        "Conic curves, or conic sections, are the curves formed by the intersection of a plane with a double-napped cone. They are fundamental in geometry and can be classified into three main types based on the angle and position of the intersecting plane:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Circle**: Formed when the plane cuts the cone perpendicular to its axis. All points on the circle are equidistant from its center.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ellipse**: Occurs when the plane intersects the cone at an angle, but does not pass through the base. The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to its two foci is constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parabola**: Formed when the plane is parallel to the slant height of the cone. Every point on the parabola is equidistant from a fixed point (focus) and a fixed line (directrix).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hyperbola**: Occurs when the plane cuts through both nappes of the cone. The difference in distances from any point on the hyperbola to its two foci is constant.\n",
